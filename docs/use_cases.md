# Google AI Studio Chat Branches Extension - Complete Use Cases

## **1. User opens extension on ANY non-AI-Studio webpage**
**What shows:** `incorrectDomainView` (red message)
```
"This plugin works on AI Studio chat pages with URLs like:

**URL:** `https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat` or `/prompts/new`
